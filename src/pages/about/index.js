							My name is Zach Azar (he/him) and this is my homepage. I&apos;m a
							software engineer and technology entrepreneur living in
							Albuquerque, NM. I&apos;m currently taking a sabbatical and
							exploring my hometown after being on the west coast for the past 6
							years.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&apos;ve been developing software for 10+ years and have earned
							my Bachelor&apos;s and Master&apos;s degrees in Computer Science.
							In 2016, I was a technical co-founder (it didn&apos;t blast off,
							unfortunately) but then I joined
							<a target="blank" href="https://www.buildingconnected.com/">
								{' '}
								BuildingConnected{' '}
							</a>{' '}
							and was able to experience real startup growth in San Francisco
							üöÄ. Starting as a full-stack engineer when the business had 30
							employees, I ramped up to lead a team of engineers and then became
							an Engineering Manager helping to train other managers. Meanwhile,
							I was overseeing engineering for our subcontractor product (
							<a
								href="https://www.buildingconnected.com/bid-board/"
								target="blank"
							>
								Bid Board
							</a>{' '}
							) and working closely with Product and Design leads.
						</p>
						<p>
							It&apos;s been a whirlwind! After we were acquired by{' '}
							<a href="https://www.autodesk.com/" target="blank">
								Autodesk
							</a>{' '}
							in 2019 with 230 employees, I decided to return to the technical
							track and worked remotely out of Seattle in various technical
							roles including as a Platform Team lead and a consultant (similar
							to a Software Architect) for teams looking to scale their web
							applications. Check out my <Link to="/resume">r√©sum√© page</Link>{' '}
							to see all of the skills that I&apos;ve picked up along the way.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my free time, I enjoy biking around the city and taking day
							trips with my wife and{' '}

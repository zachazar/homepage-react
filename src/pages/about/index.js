						My name is Zach Azar and I&apos;m a Software Engineer living in
						Seattle, WA. Originally from Albuquerque, NM, I discovered Computer
						Science while attending Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN and
						I&apos;ve never looked back.
					</p>
					<p>
						After graduating, I worked in industry for a few years, then
						returned to academia to work as a Teaching Assistant and earn my
						M.S. from the University of Denver.
					</p>
					<p>
						After graduating, I was a technical co-founder briefly (it
						didn&apos;t blast off unfortunately) but then I joined
						<a target="blank" href="https://www.buildingconnected.com/">
							{' '}
							BuildingConnected{' '}
						</a>
						and was fortunate enough to experience real startup growth in SF ðŸš€.
						Starting as a full-stack engineer, I ramped up to lead a team of
						engineers, and then became an Engineering Manager helping to train
						other managers and overseeing engineering of our subcontractor
						product.
					</p>
					<p>
						It&apos;s been a whirlwind. After we got acquired by Autodesk, I
						decided to return to the technical track and now I work fully remote
						out of Seattle for our Backend Platform team.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, my favorite weekend activity is to road trip around
						Washington with my wife and dog.

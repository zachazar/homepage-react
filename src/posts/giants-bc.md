# Individualism is too romanticized

In our society, it's assumed that the _individual_ is solely responsible for their own success. Scrolling through Twitter/Instagram reinforces this belief. You scroll and ask _"how are they that accomplished?!"_ and you assume it's their intelligence or natural gifts, not their environment nor community that got them there. I fall victim to this thinking often.

In reality, it's their network and relationships that created an environment to build those experiences, insights, and achievements. That's what happened for me at BuildingConnected and I'm so thankful for it.

One reason I bring this up is, **most of the content that I plan to publish about engineering culture, management, and team building was introduced to me by incredible individuals**. Over the years, I helped to iterate on the processes but very few I created outright.

**I am standing on the shoulders of giants**

and I couldn't be more thankful. This list isn't meant to exhaustively cover everyone who has influenced me or had an impact on my success (like my wife, family, friends, teachers, advisors, who all played a huge part).

This post is more meant to give attribution to those from who I specifically drew ideas and inspiration in the coming posts.

# My giants from BuildingConnected (acquired by Autodesk)

[Jesse Pedersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessepedersen/)

Though this list is not in order, Jesse has been by far my most influential giant. He has taught me to trust my gut, take action, be brave, and move fast (which are important qualities that counter my hindering perfectionism). He's an incredible leader in all aspects of building a great product, designing it, and engineering it. He exponentially magnifies his impact by building incredible teams and the culture and processes to allow those teams and individuals to flourish.

[Al Urim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alurim/), [Karen Rose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenmrose/), [Thomas Beirne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beirnet/), and [Bradford Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradford-cook-516a7511/)

These four make up the original engineering manager group with who I worked closely. The vast majority of my management and team-building capacities are a direct result of their ideas or from collaborating with their great minds.

[Ashu Agte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aagte/)

Ashu represents the highest caliber of an engineering manager that I've had the pleasure to work with. His mentorship allowed me to advance from a figure-it-out-as-I-go team lead to a manager helping to prepare new managers. I would not have been able to succeed without his guidance, trust, and empathy.

[Jenny Ji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyji/)

Through Jenny, I learned why a team should keep such an incredibly high bar for design. That bar still helps differentiate BuildingConnected in the industry. Jenny also introduced me to personal finance and many of my personal finance fundamentals (which I plan to share in future posts ðŸ™‚) come from discussions with her and from books that she has recommended.

[Chelsea Hodge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelseahodge/) and [Abbie Hanright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbie-hanright/)

Chelsea and Abbie were my collaborative leaders in product and design, respectively. Their attention to detail (not only in design but in the process and systems behind a product) truly helped to shape my view on building a great product and sub-organization to support it.

[Zac Hays](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacthepm/)

Through Zac, I learned why it's so important to have a solid vision along with strategies and roadmaps. He's even given [talks](https://zac-hays.com/) on this. This giant taught me the value of defining and measuring success as well as how to hire phenomenal product managers.

## Thank you giants.
